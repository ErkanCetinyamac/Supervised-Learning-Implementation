# Supervised-Learning-Implementation
Welcome to my supervised learning implementation kernel. In this kernel, I will carry out supervised learning  algorithms to predict the gender of the person according to features in "Heart Disease UCI" dataset and compare accuracy of those algorithms  confusion matrix.

Check {the kernel] on kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/glorfindel94/supervised-learning-implementation)
